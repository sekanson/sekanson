- 👋 Hi, I’m @sekanson

I am the second son. I am new to code and working towards building the skillsets i need to be able to develop something that can change the world. 

Now, being the second son has a bit of meaning. It has a lot to do with not being handed anything and having to fight for everything you have and want. I guess, the best way to think about it is the first son is heir to the throne. The second son is... well i guess the back up? yeah.. that narrative never cut it for me and its why i have always set out to be remarkable. my own harshest critic and always competing with the man in the mirror. 

If im being real, the name is just dope. The mean is true and it hangs on me, but the truth is i came up with it one day and i really fuck with it. meaning and all. oh, and i hope you caught that it spells "no snakes" backwards. So if you are that type of dude or dudette.. faaaack you.

I guess thats it.. do people even read this? I guess ill find out. I have no idea what the fuck git hub even is. I have an idea i guess.. i kinda get it.. but not nearly to the point or level that i want to. 

annnd thats why im here.

alright, peace.
